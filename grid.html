        Organizational climate and organizational culture are distinct
        concepts.[3] Climate and culture are both important aspects of the

        related, climate often proves easier to assess and change. At an
        individual level of analysis the concept is called individual
        psychological climate. These individual perceptions are often aggregated
        or collected for analysis and understanding at the team or group level,
        or the divisional, functional, or overall organizational level
